# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: inconsistent triggering during rapid authentication state changes or network issues.  The `authBug.js` file shows a flawed implementation, while `authSolution.js` provides a robust solution.

## Problem
The standard `onAuthStateChanged` listener may fail to reflect immediate changes in authentication status, potentially leading to incorrect UI updates or navigation.

## Solution
The improved listener includes error handling and employs a debounce technique to ensure reliable responses to authentication state updates. This approach helps mitigate the impact of network jitter and rapid authentication transitions.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run `authBug.js` to reproduce the issue. Then, run `authSolution.js` to observe the improved behavior.
